# German-Credit-Data
This project is about the analysis of credit risks of German Credit Data.

Starting from a database provided by the <i>Institut f"ur Statistik und "Okonometrie</i>, the goal was to predict whether a debtor is trustable or not.
In order to obtain it, I applied an analysis to explore the data, reorganize it and then apply Machine Learning algorithms.
